## Project Overview <a name="project-overview"></a>

This project develops a sophisticated machine learning framework to predict and analyze disease outbreak risks across different regional types. The analysis enables:

- **Early Warning Systems:** Predictive analytics for outbreak risks
- **Resource Allocation:** Data-driven healthcare resource distribution
- **Policy Development:** Evidence-based healthcare policy recommendations

## Dataset Description <a name="dataset-description"></a>

### Data Source
- 10,000 regional records
- Multiple categorical and numerical features
- Comprehensive healthcare and environmental metrics

### Key Features
1. **Demographic Data**
   - Population density: Range 10.51 - 9999.35
   - Median income: Range -2212.13 - 103997.18
   - Age demographics: Elderly and child percentages

2. **Healthcare Metrics**
   - Vaccination rate: 50-85% coverage
   - Healthcare accessibility: 0.4-0.9 score range
   - Disease incidents: Historical data

3. **Environmental Factors**
   - Air quality index: Range 30.01 - 499.01
   - Temperature and humidity data
   - Annual rainfall measurements

## Problem Statement <a name="problem-statement"></a>

### Objectives
1. Develop a classification model for risk categories
2. Implement clustering for regional risk patterns
3. Identify key risk factors
4. Propose targeted interventions

### Success Criteria
- Model accuracy > 90%
- Clear actionable insights
- Practical implementation strategies

## Methodology <a name="methodology"></a>

### 1. Data Preprocessing
```python
# Handle missing values
df['vaccination_rate'].fillna(df['vaccination_rate'].median(), inplace=True)
df['healthcare_accessibility_score'].fillna(df['healthcare_accessibility_score'].median(), inplace=True)

# Feature scaling
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)
```

### 2. Feature Engineering
```python
# Created new features
df['population_health_index'] = df['population_density'] * (1 - df['healthcare_accessibility_score'])
df['environmental_risk'] = df['air_quality_index'] * df['avg_humidity'] / 100
```

### 3. Model Development
- **Clustering:** K-means (k=2)
- **Classification:** Random Forest
- **Validation:** 5-fold cross-validation

## Key Findings <a name="key-findings"></a>

### Regional Risk Analysis
```
Rural Areas:
- Risk Score: 41.191 (±6.446)
- Vaccination Rate: 60.3%
- Healthcare Access: 0.650

Urban Areas:
- Risk Score: 39.818 (±6.463)
- Vaccination Rate: 75.3%
- Healthcare Access: 0.643
```

### Risk Factors Impact
1. **Healthcare Infrastructure**
   - Strong negative correlation with risk (-0.32)
   - Critical in rural areas

2. **Environmental Factors**
   - Air quality significance in urban areas
   - Humidity impact on outbreak duration

## Model Performance <a name="model-performance"></a>

### Classification Metrics
```python
Accuracy:    94.9%
Precision:   93.5%
Recall:      94.9%
